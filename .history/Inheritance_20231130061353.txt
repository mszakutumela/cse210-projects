What is inheritance and why is it important?

Inheritance is like a parent child relationship. A daughter may inherited
certain physical features or personality traits from their mother. The parent
class whose attributes and methods are inherited is called the base or super class.
The child class that inherits these atttributes and methods is called the derived or
sub class. 
Inheritance is a very important and useful principle when it comes to object-oriented
programming. 







An example of inheritance from the program I wrote:

public class MathAssignment : Assignment
{
    private string _textbookSection;
    private string _problems;

    public MathAssignment(string studentName, string assignmentTopic, string textbookSection, string problems) : base(studentName, assignmentTopic)
    {
        _textbookSection = textbookSection;
        _problems = problems;
    }
    
    public string GetHomeworkList()
    {
        return $"Section {_textbookSection} Problems {_problems}";
    }
    
}
