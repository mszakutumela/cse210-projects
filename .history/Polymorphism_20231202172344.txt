What is polymorphism and why is it important?

The skill of one line of code having the ability to take on diverse actions
at once, depenidng on the framework is called, Polymorphism. Polymorphism 
sounds is like a family. Through the principle of Inheritance a family is 
formed where we have a parent class and a child classes. Polymorphism, like
Inheritance is also a very important principle when it comes to object-oriented 
programming.
Polymorphism is gives the developer the ability to utilise methods from Inheritance
to complete various responsibilities. In this case the developer is able to use the 
same name method in various ways. Polymorphism helps a function to behave differently
for different situations. It helps the developer to reuse a method in many differeny 
ways. A good example is found in method overriding. Method overriding is when a child
class overrrides or changes the behov










An example of polymorphism from the program I wrote:

public class Shape
{
    protected string _color;

    public string GetColor()
    {
        return _color;
    }

    public void SetColor(string color)
    {
        _color = color;
    }

    public Shape(string color)
    {
        _color = color;
    }

    public virtual double GetArea() (this is the main example, where vitual is used)
    {
        return 0;
    }
}

public class Square : Shape
{
    private double _side;

    public Square(string color, double side) : base (color)
    {
        _side = side;
    }

    public override double GetArea() (this is the main example, where override is used)
    {
        return _side * _side;
    }
}
