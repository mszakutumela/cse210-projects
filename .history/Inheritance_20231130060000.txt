What is inheritance and why is it important?

Inheritance is like a parent child relationship. A daughter may inherited
certain physical features or personality traits from their mother. 






An example of inheritance from the program I wrote:

public class MathAssignment : Assignment
{
    private string _textbookSection;
    private string _problems;

    public MathAssignment(string studentName, string assignmentTopic, string textbookSection, string problems) : base(studentName, assignmentTopic)
    {
        _textbookSection = textbookSection;
        _problems = problems;
    }
    
    public string GetHomeworkList()
    {
        return $"Section {_textbookSection} Problems {_problems}";
    }
    
}
