What is abstraction and why is it important?

Abstraction is a method that simplifies difficult ideas. In the abstraction method, certain 
features are eliminated from an object, leaving behind the vital ones. Abstraction divides
functions into various objects, like classes and methods. In this way the developer can reuse
various classes in order to achieve the desired output.

An example of an abstraction is the print function in Python. For example: print("My name is Ayanda").

The print fuction can be used within another function to create another abstraction, which can be a 
process grouping abstractions. This is how social media platforms like Facebook is written.

An example of abstraction from the program I wrote:

public void DisplayJobDetails()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{_jobTitle} ({_companyName}) {_startYear}-{_endYear}");
    }
