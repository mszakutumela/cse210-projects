// Step 5: Create the WritingAssignment class
// 1. Follow the same pattern as before by creating a new file for the WritingAssignment class.
// 2. Create the class and set up the inheritance relationship.
// 3. Add the member variables and set up the constructor as you did for the MathAssignment class.
// 4. Add the GetWritingInformation() method.
// 5. Notice that this method needs to access the _studentName variable defined in the base class. 
// Even though WritingAssignment class inherited this attribute, it is private, so you cannot access 
// it directly in the derived class. To get the data you need for the method you can either make the 
// variable protected in the base class, or you can create a public GetStudentName method to return it.
