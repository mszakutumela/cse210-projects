Step 4: Create the Square class
In a new file, create the Square class.
Make sure this class inherits from the base class.
Create a constructor that accepts the color and the side, and then call the base constructor with the color.
Create the _side attribute as a private member variable.
Override the GetArea() method from the base class and fill in the body of this function to return the area.
