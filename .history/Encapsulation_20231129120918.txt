What is encapsulation and why is it important?

A capsule is a container. Encapsulation is when the developer decides to use the 
access modifier such as, "private", to seal in the variables or data within a 
specific class, so that it is not accessible to other classes and methods within
the program. An eEncapsulation is like a safe where only the owner of the safe can access
the contents inside the safe.









An example of encapsulation from the program I wrote:

public class Fraction
{
    private int _numerator;
    private int _denominator;

    public Fraction()
    {
        _numerator = 1;
        _denominator = 1;
    }

    public Fraction(int topNumber)
    {
        _numerator = topNumber;
        _denominator = 1;
    }

    public Fraction(int top, int bottom)
    {
        _numerator = top;
        _denominator = bottom;
    }
}
