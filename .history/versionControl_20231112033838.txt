What is version control and why is it important?

A version control system (VCS) keeps an eye on the changes made to a project. This project can be done
by one person or a group. As changes are made to a project, a version control system keeps a 
documented history of all changes and these changes can be retrieved at any time.
A VCS documents what changes were made, who made those changes, when were the changes made and why were
the changes made. 
Git is an example of a distributed VCS. A distributed version control system is important, because it 
helps all developers working on a specific project to have the full copy of the project and its history.
Git allows collaboration to happen at any time, while keeping the integrity of the source code.
