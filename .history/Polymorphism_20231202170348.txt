What is polymorphism and why is it important?

The skill of one line of code having the ability to take on diverse actions
at once, depenidng on the framework is called, Polymorphism. Polymorphism 
sounds is like a marriage. Through the principle of Inheritance a marrige is 
formed classesThe family relative to Polymorphism is 
Inheritance. Polymorphism means several methods, 










An example of polymorphism from the program I wrote:

public class Shape
{
    protected string _color;

    public string GetColor()
    {
        return _color;
    }

    public void SetColor(string color)
    {
        _color = color;
    }

    public Shape(string color)
    {
        _color = color;
    }

    public virtual double GetArea()
    {
        return 0;
    }
}

public class Square : Shape
{
    private double _side;

    public Square(string color, double side) : base (color)
    {
        _side = side;
    }

    public override double GetArea()
    {
        return _side * _side;
    }
}
