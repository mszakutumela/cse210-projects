What is encapsulation and why is it important?

A capsule is a container. Encapsulation is when the developer decides to use the 
access modifier such as, "private", to seal in the variables or data within a 
specific class, so that it is not accessible to other classes and methods within
the program. A class that uses encapsulation will act as a middle-man container 
that holds all the variables, data and logic enclosed within it, and it will prevent 
other parts of the program from access those details. Encapsulation is like a safe where 
only the owner of the safe can access the contents inside the safe.

Encapsulation helps to group codes into logical objects that represents actual objects and ideas.
It helps to recycle the code, so that the developer can create a code that allows objects to be
collected and put together in different ways. With encapsulation the developer can ensure that 
the data is protected.

An example of encapsulation from the program I wrote:

public class Fraction
{
    private int _numerator;
    private int _denominator;

    public Fraction()
    {
        _numerator = 1;
        _denominator = 1;
    }

    public Fraction(int topNumber)
    {
        _numerator = topNumber;
        _denominator = 1;
    }

    public Fraction(int top, int bottom)
    {
        _numerator = top;
        _denominator = bottom;
    }
}
