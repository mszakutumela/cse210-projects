What is encapsulation and why is it important?

A capsule is a container. Encapsulation is when the developer decides to use the 
access modifier such as, "private", 







An example of encapsulation from the program I wrote:

public class Fraction
{
    private int _numerator;
    private int _denominator;

    public Fraction()
    {
        _numerator = 1;
        _denominator = 1;
    }

    public Fraction(int topNumber)
    {
        _numerator = topNumber;
        _denominator = 1;
    }

    public Fraction(int top, int bottom)
    {
        _numerator = top;
        _denominator = bottom;
    }
}
