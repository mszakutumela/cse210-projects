What is version control and why is it important?

A version control system (VCS) keeps an eye on the changes made to a project. This project can be done
by one person or a group. As changes are made to a project, a version control system keeps a 
documented history of all changes and these changes can be retrieved at any time.
A VCS documents what changes were made, who made those changes, when were the changes made and why were
the changes made.
